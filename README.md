# Caden Oslund's Portfolio

## Project Ideas

* Othello App (shows that I can program mobile apps using Kotlin, as well as complex logic)

* Picture of the Day (shows that I can use APIs)

* Space Race (keep it simple, make it look nice)

* Making an OS (from scratch, I'm pretty sure I have a guide bookmarked)

* Mediaeval Game (mix of Elden Ring and Monster Hunter?)
