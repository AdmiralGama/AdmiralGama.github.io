                    <h2>Fragments</h2>
                    <p>Flux has a lot of fragments which are basically various splits of his personality, because apparently we couldn't just stop at one system and have a system inside of a system TwT</p>
                    <p>This page is a list of the smaller ones that aren't important enough to get their own page (the important one's each mention in their description that they are a fragment)</p>

                    <h2>Anxiety Flux</h2>
                    <p>Embodiment of Flux's anxiety. Basically just says sorry a lot and cries in a corner-</p>

                    <h2>Heartbreak Flux</h2>
                    <p>Fragment of Flux created when they thought Ram didn't love them and they had a breakdown over it. Really heartbroken and cries a lot.</p>
                    <p>(doesn't exactly have a reason to exist since Flux is dating Ram now?)</p>

                    <h2>Little Flux(?)</h2>
                    <p>Not sure if they're actually a fragment or just Flux's weird relationship with the concept of age</p>

                    <h2>Amnesia Flux</h2>
                    <p>Basically just Flux except they seem to not remember anything</p>
                    <p>Dunno yet if that's just they don't remember the past or if their memory will reset every time</p>
