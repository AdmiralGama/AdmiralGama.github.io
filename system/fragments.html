                    <h2>Fragments</h2>
                    <p>Flux has a lot of fragments which are basically various splits of his personality, because apparently we couldn't just stop at one system and have a system inside of a system TwT</p>
                    <!--<p>This page is a list of the smaller ones that aren't important enough to get their own page (the important one's each mention in their description that they are a fragment)</p>-->
                    <p>This page lists all of them except for <a href="stella.html">Stella</a> who has her own page because she walks the line between fragment and full headmate</p>

                    <h2>Aster</h2>
                    <p>Has a lot of power over the system and kinda just fucks things up when they're around.</p>
                    <p>Not intentionally, just their presence is very disruptive</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Void</h2>
                    <p>Kinda a weirdo lol but not in a bad way</p>
                    <p>Basically just spaces out or says weird shit, not around very often and usually isn't for long</p>
                    <p>Used to really not want to exist, but they've either just accepted or suppressed it at this point</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Anxiety Flux</h2>
                    <p>Embodiment of Flux's anxiety. Basically just says sorry a lot and cries in a corner-</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Heartbreak Flux</h2>
                    <p>Fragment of Flux created when they thought Ram didn't love them and they had a breakdown over it. Really heartbroken and cries a lot.</p>
                    <p>(doesn't exactly have a reason to exist since Flux is dating Ram now?)</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Little Flux(?)</h2>
                    <p>Not sure if they're actually a fragment or just Flux's weird relationship with the concept of age</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Amnesia Flux</h2>
                    <p>Basically just Flux except they seem to not remember anything</p>
                    <p>Dunno yet if that's just they don't remember the past or if their memory will reset every time</p>
